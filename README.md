Spidertron Weapon Switcher
==================

If you've been wanting the spidertron to fire more than just rockets, this is the mod for you! It now contains machine guns, shotguns, flamethrowers, cannons and rocket launchers.

-----
Features
-----

- Press *Control + Tab* (or *\\* ) whilst in a spidertron or whilst hovering over one with the mouse to rotate through 5 different weapon options
- Ammo is saved between weapons, so you can rotate back to a weapon and its ammo will still be there
- Machine gun, shotgun and flamethrower have all been given their own 'spidertron version' with increased range and damage compared to normal
- Tank cannon and rocket launcher have the same stats as when fired from a tank and a spidertron respectively

-----
Limitations
-----

- When you switch weapons, any items inside that spidertron's inventory will lose all associated data. *Do not store modular/power armor in a spidertron. The equipment inside of them will be lost when you switch weapons*.
- When you switch weapons, that spidertron's name will be lost, it will stop moving, and any remotes connected to it that are stored in an inventory more than 30 tiles from a player will become disconnected

Future Updates?
-----

- Please suggest modded weapons that should be added to the weapon rotation when using those mods
