Spidertron Weapon Switcher
==================

If you've been wanting the spidertron to fire more than just rockets, this is the mod for you!

-----
Features
-----

- Press Control + Tab whilst in a spidertron or whilst hovering over one with the mouse to rotate through 5 different weapon options
- Ammo is saved between weapons, so you can rotate back to a weapon and its ammo will still be there
- Machine gun, shotgun and flamethrower have all been given their own 'spidertron version' with increased range and damage compared to normal
- Tank cannon is left the same as when fired from a tank

-----
Limitations
-----

- When you switch weapons, that spidertron's name will be lost, all remotes connected to it will disconnect, and it will stop moving

-----
Future Updates?
-----

- Automatically update all remotes to point to the 'new' spidertron upon weapon switch
- Please suggest modded weapons that should be added to the weapon rotation when using those mods
